check_serials.py - compare serials in two different pickle files
combine_dicts.py - create a dictionary with upper and lower details in it from seperate files
IFEED_check.py - check to see if 
Interpolation.py - not sure what this one does... makes nice plots though
Line_Troubleshoot.py
plot_dots.py
plot_res_strength_Bn_q95.py - plots resonant strenght as a func of q95 and Bn (make animation that includes phase?)
Post_Proc_Funcs.py
q95_search.py - find nearest q95 value in a dictionary and print out its details
return_serial.py
test_probe_location.py
chu_memo.py
Eq_space.py
Interpolation3.py - looks like a predecessor to the plotting the pickup output as a func of q95 and Bn
line_animation.py
MARS_plot_results.py
plot_resonant_strength.py - plots resonant strength as a func of q95 and phasing for fixed Bn - reads in pickle files - what generates them?
Plot_ROTE_results.py
PythonMARS_funcs.py
qscaling.py - plots q profile scaling that happens in Corsica - why does Matt do it this way?
